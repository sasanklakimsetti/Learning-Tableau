control chart is a type of line chart 

Steps:
1. Create a continuous line chart to show monthly profit.
2. Create Parameter "Standard deviation" with allowable values 1,2,3
3. Create calculated fields “Lower Bound”
WINDOW_AVG(SUM([Profit]))- (WINDOW_STDEV(SUM([Profit]))* [Standard Deviation])

4. Create calculated field “Upper Bound”
WINDOW_AVG(SUM([Profit]))+ (WINDOW_STDEV(SUM([Profit]))* [Standard Deviation])

5. Create calculated field “Outlier”
SUM([Profit])<[Lower Bound] OR SUM([Profit])>[Upper bound]



We chose standard deviation as a parameter so that we can show the varying of number of outliers.
Drop Measure Values to the side of Sum(Sales) and drop all except Lower Bound and Upper Bound.
Make the chart as dual axis by clicking on the dual axis in the dropdown of Measure Values
Synchronize the axis by right clicking on the right vertical axis
Hide the values axis by right clicking the axis and click on 'Hide axis'
Drop outliers into color
Number of outliers depends on the value of standard deviation.
